## Notes

This project was a bit more challenging, but also enjoyable as I was able to pay tribute to remarkable women across the world! Utilizing state management in React to separate the form for users building a quiz from the quiz itself was harder than I expected. Also, picking the right styles and fonts took me a while. It was a great learning experience, and I feel a lot more confident with useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks now!
